Here's a section for your README that provides instructions for running your `start_all_service.py` and `client.py` scripts:

## Running the Application

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Services**

   First, you need to start all the necessary services. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python start_all_service.py
   ```

   This will initialize and start all the required services for the application.

2. **Run the Client**

   After starting the services, you can run the client application. In a new terminal window, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

   This will start the client application and allow you to interact with the services.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Start all services
python start_all_service.py

# In a new terminal window, start the client
python client.py
```

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed. You can install them using:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Make sure you have the correct Python version installed as specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, verify that all services are running correctly by checking the logs or error messages displayed in the terminal.
- Ensure that your network connection is active and properly configured for the client and services to communicate.
